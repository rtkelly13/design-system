/**
 * `renderReport` — a `.tsx` file in, one self-contained `.html` file out.
 *
 * The point of this is to replace the HTML an agent would otherwise hand-write.
 * A report built from these components inherits the whole system: the four-rung
 * theme ladder, roles whose contrast is audited by `pnpm check:contrast`, and
 * components whose appearance is pinned by the visual suite. A hand-written
 * `<div style="...">` inherits none of it and is a fresh design decision every
 * time.
 *
 * The pipeline is three steps and no intermediate artefacts:
 *
 *   TSX --esbuild--> markup --class attributes--> candidates --tailwind--> CSS
 *
 * See `candidates.ts` for why reading the candidates out of finished markup is
 * what makes a single pass possible.
