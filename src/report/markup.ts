/**
 * Turning a `.tsx` file into markup, in one esbuild pass.
 *
 * Node cannot import TSX, and a report will import this package plus whatever
 * else its author reached for, so something has to transpile and resolve. esbuild
 * does both in ~200ms, which is what keeps the whole generator inside the time an
 * agent will actually wait.
 *
 * Three decisions here are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **The entry is a generated wrapper, fed through `stdin`.** The report
 *      itself only has to export a component; the render call lives in code we
 *      control, so the file an agent writes stays a plain component file.
 *   2. **`resolveDir` is the report's own directory.** Imports resolve from where
 *      the report lives, so a report can import the author's own modules.
 *   3. **The bundle is closed over — nothing external.** It is written to a temp
 *      directory and imported from there, so if `react` were left external it
 *      would resolve against `/tmp` and fail. Bundling React in also guarantees
 *      one copy, which is the difference between rendering and a hook error.
