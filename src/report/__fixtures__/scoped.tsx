/**
 * Fixture: a differently-themed panel inside a report.
 *
 * `dim` is chosen deliberately — it is neither the document's level (`white`)
 * nor ThemeProvider's own default, so the assertion cannot pass by accident if
 * the prop stops being read. An earlier version of this fixture used a `level`
 * prop that does not exist; React dropped it silently and the panel rendered the
 * default, which looked exactly like success.
