/**
 * The document around a report.
 *
 * This is the one place in the package that emits raw HTML rather than JSX, and
 * it is deliberately the smallest possible amount: there is no element in a
 * component to hang a `className` on for `<html>` or `<head>`, which is the same
 * exemption `styles.css` has for document-level styling.
 *
 * The level goes on `<html>` as `data-theme` *and* as a class, matching what
 * `ThemeProvider` writes at runtime — the attribute is what the generated CSS
 * selects on, the class is mirrored for consumers whose own CSS keys off it.
