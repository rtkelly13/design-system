/**
 * The design system's own rules, applied to a report's TSX before it renders.
 *
 * A report written outside this repo is otherwise unchecked: no ESLint config
 * exists, `pnpm check:tokens` only ever scans `src/components` and
 * `src/stories`, and esbuild strips types without reading them. So the file most
 * likely to be written by an agent in a hurry was the one file nothing looked at.
 *
 * Two families of rule, and the split is deliberate:
 *
 *   - **Errors** are the token rules from `src/lib/tokenRules.ts`, at budget
 *     **zero**. Those files carry pre-existing debt and are ratcheted; a report
 *     written today has none, and a hex literal in one renders identically on
 *     `midnight` and on `white` — exactly the failure the ladder exists to
 *     prevent. Blocking is right.
 *   - **Warnings** are the two ways a report can be *valid* React and still
 *     wrong as a static document: it renders no client JS, and it should produce
 *     the same bytes twice. Neither is always a mistake, so neither blocks —
 *     `--strict` promotes them for CI.
