/**
 * The manifesto's specimens, as stories.
 *
 * They are stories rather than plain JSX in the MDX for one reason: Storybook's
 * decorators wrap *stories*, so a docs page carrying none of them is a page the
 * `Level` toolbar cannot reach. `.storybook/preview.ts` sets `data-theme` on the
 * preview iframe's own `<html>`, so one rendered story themes the whole document
 * — the surrounding prose included. That is what makes the toolbar authoritative
 * here instead of a second switch on the page.
 *
 * `!dev` keeps them out of the sidebar. Each one is a fragment of a single page
 * and reads as noise beside the real component entries; the page is the artifact,
 * and `Manifesto` is its one sidebar row. The tag sits on each story rather than
 * on the meta on purpose — meta tags propagate to the attached docs entry, which
 * would hide the page this whole file exists to render.
 *
 * Every specimen reads `src/theme/levels.ts` at render time — see
 * `./manifesto/specimens.tsx`.
