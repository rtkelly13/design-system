/**
 * The theme ladder — the single place a level name or a level's colour is written.
 *
 * Everything else in the system derives from this file: the CSS in
 * `theme.generated.css`, the runtime provider, the Storybook toolbar, the
 * walkthrough matrix, and the contrast gate. Adding a level here is a type
 * error everywhere it has not been handled; adding a *role* is a type error in
 * every level at once. That is the guarantee — not a convention.
 *
 * ## Why a ladder and not a polarity, at two levels
 *
 * The ladder ran to four rungs — `midnight`, `dim`, `bright`, `white` — on the
 * argument that two themes can share a polarity and still want different
 * grounds. That argument was sound; the assumption under it was not. Nothing
 * consumed the fourth rung and nothing reached the second, so three of the four
 * were paid for and never collected. The pair is `midnight` and `light`.
 *
 * Polarity nevertheless stays a *declared property of a level* rather than the
 * axis, and this is worth stating because the collapse is usually assumed to
 * end it. It does not, because **neither level is named for its polarity**:
 * `midnight` has polarity `dark`, `sketch` has polarity `light`. So
 * {@link SYSTEM_LEVEL} still has a real job — mapping two media states onto two
 * names that are neither of them — and a `Record<Polarity, T>` remains a
 * different type from a `Record<ThemeLevel, T>`. Had the levels been called
 * `dark` and `light` the two would have collapsed into one thing and polarity
 * could have gone with them.
 *
 * Both polarity variants therefore survive: `dark:` and `light:` each span a
 * polarity rather than naming a level, so neither collides with a level
 * variant. `midnight` names a ground; `sketch` names a surface and a way of
 * drawing on it. Neither is a synonym for its polarity, which is the property
 * that keeps a third level cheap.
 *
 * ## Why every value is a literal
 *
 * The previous token layer derived surfaces, text and borders from two poles
 * with `color-mix()` percentages. Percentages tuned against near-black do not
 * hold at the light end — `border-subtle` at 28% is a visible hairline on
 * black and invisible on paper. Literals also make the ladder *checkable*:
 * `pnpm check:contrast` can compute every text-on-surface ratio without a
 * browser — 220 pairs, 110 per Level, including every Hue against every
 * ground, which is what makes hand-tuned literals sustainable rather than
 * twenty times the manual review. Stated per Level deliberately: 440 was
 * written here in the commit that collapsed four Levels to two, so the total
 * was stale the moment it was typed.
 *
 * The one exception is `surface.overlay`, which is a scrim and needs alpha.
