/**
 * A rule drawn in characters rather than pixels.
 *
 * The glyph is part of the design, and it is not the same glyph on every level.
 * The dark end of the ladder leans on terminal devices — scanlines, `>`
 * prompts, `//====//` rules. The light end is paper, where the equivalent
 * device is a hand-ruled pencil dash. Same component, same role, different
 * mark.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as its own component
 *
 * That behaviour used to live in the *consumer's* stylesheet, as
 * `.sketch .ascii-divider::after { content: "· ─ ─ ·" }` in the blog, overriding
 * a `::after` in the design system. Three things were wrong with that:
 *
 *   - The design intent — "this rule is drawn differently on paper" — was
 *     stated in a downstream repo, so the system did not actually own its own
 *     divider.
 *   - It keyed off `.sketch`, a level name that no longer exists. Anything
 *     built that way silently stops matching when the ladder changes, because
 *     a selector that matches nothing fails quietly.
 *   - It forced the design system to keep a bare `.ascii-divider` class as a
 *     styling hook purely so a pseudo-element had something to attach to,
 *     which was the last hole in the styling-lives-in-TSX rule.
 *
 * Encoding it here closes all three: the mapping is a `Record<Polarity, …>`, so
 * it is exhaustive by type, and the glyph is real text rather than generated
 * content — which means it is selectable, searchable, and readable by a screen
 * reader if it ever needed to be (it is `aria-hidden`, being decoration).
