/**
 * Tests for the lint rules themselves.
 *
 * These are the only enforcement of two rules — address a colour by its role,
 * and do not name a class that does not exist — since the counting ratchet they
 * replaced is gone. A lint rule with no test is one you find out about on the
 * day it quietly stops matching, and both of these have already surprised me
 * once: my first probe of the classname rule injected a fake class into
 * `className={x.trim()}`, saw silence, and I read it as passing. It was a code
 * shape the rule cannot traverse.
 *
 * Deliberately run through the real `ESLint` API against the repo's own
 * `eslint.config.mjs` rather than against a hand-built config. Most of what can
 * break here is configuration, not rule logic: the file globs that keep
 * `levels.ts` out of scope, `cssConfigPath` pointing at the plural filename,
 * `recipe` being in the traversed function list, and the whitelist being derived
 * rather than typed. A synthetic config would test none of that.
