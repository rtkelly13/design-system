 * The published artifact's shape, as opposed to its contents.
 *
 * These are the fields and files a consumer meets before any of the code runs,
 * and none of them are covered by anything else here: `tsup` does not read
 * them, `typecheck` cannot see them, and the visual suite is three layers away.
 * The failure they guard against is the one that already happened — `files`
 * listed `LICENSE` and `license` claimed MIT while no such file existed, so the
 * tarball shipped an MIT claim with no licence text for two minor versions.
 *
 * Note `pnpm test` runs *before* `pnpm build` in CI, so `dist/` does not exist
 * here. Only the checked-in entries can be asserted to be present; `dist` is
 * asserted to be *declared*, which is the part a human gets wrong.
