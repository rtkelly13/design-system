# Where the base palette comes from

**Siblings:** [`adr/0003`](./adr/0003-two-levels-independently-authored.md) (the decision this
serves) · [`adr/0001`](./adr/0001-hues-declared-below-roles.md) (why a Hue vocabulary exists) ·
[`theme-taxonomy.md`](./theme-taxonomy.md) (what a Level must declare)

**This file contains no colour values.** Per
[`adr/0002`](./adr/0002-one-source-many-emitted-surfaces.md) a colour originates exactly once,
in `src/theme/levels.ts`; writing values here would create a second origin and contradict the
decision. What this file records is *how the values were arrived at*, which is the part that
would otherwise be lost.

## The audit

`scripts/audit-colour-history.mjs` indexes every hex literal ever committed to this repo and to
`rtkelly13/blog`, per commit, and classifies each by whether it is still live and where it
lives. It is an audit, not a Gate: a colour count is not a contract, and a check that failed on
it would fail on every blog post that quotes a hex code. Output is committed at
[`data/colour-audit.tsv`](./data/colour-audit.tsv) as dated evidence.

The first run covered 573 commits — 152 here, 421 in the blog, spanning 2020-09 to 2026-09 —
and found **304 distinct values authored on or after 2026**, classified as:

| tag | n | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTHORED` | 97 | live at HEAD in a theme, token or component file — a real choice |
| `INCIDENTAL` | 21 | live, but only in one-off surfaces |
| `VENDORED` | 24 | live only inside imported artwork or generated documents |
| `RETIRED` | 162 | present in history, gone at HEAD |

Two exclusions matter, and both are tagged rather than deleted so the judgement stays
auditable. Imported drawio diagram exports under `public/static/` are frozen artwork whose
colours are someone else's decisions. The upstream blog starter's Prism palette in
`tailwind.config.js` is inherited, not chosen. Both would otherwise dominate the ranking purely
because their files never change.

## What the audit established

**The brand core is four chromatic values**, each present in essentially every commit of both
repos since 2026-01-18 — cyan, neon green, yellow and pink, plus the neutral grounds. These are
not a preference; they are what six years of work converged on, and the palette is anchored on
their **hue angles** rather than replacing them.

**Three hue territories wider than 28° had no authored colour at all** — between yellow-green
and green, between teal and cyan, and between azure and the light-mode blue.

**Violet is the empirical proof of #79.** Fifty-seven distinct violets appear in the history;
five are live and authored; none is canonical. Volume without convergence is what an absent
vocabulary looks like. Magenta is worse — one authored value, and it is a raw primary.

**The graphics surfaces reach for raw primaries.** Pure red, cyan, green, yellow and magenta
appear in `theme-engine.test.ts` and the design sandbox because no Hue vocabulary existed to
address instead. That is the same gap `adr/0002` records the blog's graphics palette forking to
fill.

## Method

Hue angles are taken from the audit. Lightness and chroma are then solved per Level, and the
two Levels are solved **differently**, which is `adr/0003` in arithmetic:

- **Dark keeps the brand literal wherever it already clears the floor**, and fills absent hues
  at the brand's own lightness so the set reads as one family. Three of the four brand values
  survive untouched; one needed lifting.
- **Light is solved downward**, because every brand light accent failed against
  `surface.sunken` — the light Level's tightest ground is its *sunken* surface where the dark
  Level's is its *raised* one. This asymmetry is why no single transform can produce one Level
  from the other.

### The floor is 5.5:1, not 4.5:1

Every value clears **5.5:1 against the tightest ground of its own Level**, above the WCAG AA
4.5:1 that `check:contrast` currently enforces. The extra headroom is #78's argument: an editor
draws selection, current-line, find-match and diff backgrounds *behind* the same tokens, and a
palette solved to exactly 4.5:1 has no room left to tint the ground. Solving once at 5.5
retires #78 rather than deferring it.

For comparison, `IEvangelist/pink-ink` — a two-theme VS Code palette with the same
neon-on-ink/vivid-on-white structure — gates at 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for non-text indicators,
and explicitly excludes decorative guides. Its canvas is pure white, so its tightest ground is
easier than this system's warm `sunken`.

### Separation must be measured in OKLab ΔE, not luma

[`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) defines **Separation** as "the luma distance between two
foreground colours". For a palette that definition is structurally useless, and the audit
proved it: solving every hue to the same contrast against the same ground **equalises luma by
construction**. Across the ten solved hues the luma ratio spread is 1.000–1.009 — every pair
looks identical to a luma test while being obviously different colours.

Perceptual distance in OKLab is the measure that works. It caught two genuine collisions a luma
test could never see: an invented blue sitting 13° from the measured brand blue (ΔE 0.024, and
the invented one was dropped), and a teal/cyan pair at ΔE 0.049. **`CONTEXT.md`'s definition
should be corrected, and `check:separation` — which is described there but does not exist as a
script — should be specified in ΔE.**

## Storage format

The palette should be **emitted** as [Design Tokens Format
Module](https://www.designtokens.org/tr/drafts/format/) files, one per Level with identical
token paths:

```
tokens/palette.dark.tokens.json
tokens/palette.light.tokens.json
```

Three reasons this is the right target rather than an invented shape:

1. **It reached its first stable version, 2025.10, in October 2025**, backed by 40+
   organisations including Adobe, Figma, Google and Microsoft, and is read or written by Figma,
   Penpot, Sketch, Tokens Studio, Style Dictionary and Terrazzo. It is a Community Group Report
   rather than a W3C Standard, and not on the Standards Track — but it is the only format with
   real multi-tool support.
2. **Its alias syntax expresses `adr/0001` natively.** A Role referencing a Hue by name is
   `"$value": "{palette.cyan}"` — a declared lookup, which is exactly the direction that ADR
   argues for and the inverse of the one it rejects.
3. **The spec deliberately says nothing about themes or modes.** One file per Level with
   matching token paths is therefore the conventional answer, and it happens to be the shape
   `adr/0003` requires anyway: two independently authored sets that share their vocabulary but
   not their values.

Two details worth knowing before implementing. A colour `$value` in 2025.10 is a **structured
object** — `{"colorSpace": "srgb", "components": [r, g, b]}`, components normalised 0–1, with
an optional `hex` alongside — not the bare hex string most examples still show. And `$type`
inherits from the enclosing group, so a `palette` group declares `"$type": "color"` once.

**Whether `oklch` is a permitted `colorSpace` I could not confirm from the published draft** —
the colour-space enumeration was not in the section retrieved. It matters because the
derivation is done in OKLCH and storing it there would keep the working space and the artifact
in agreement. Worth settling before the emitter is written; the fallback is sRGB components
with the OKLCH triple under `$extensions`.

Because these files are Derived, they are generated and drift-checked exactly as
`src/theme.css` is — never hand-edited. That work is #117, which already proposes emitting
Design Tokens JSON for the OpenDesign sidecar; this makes it two targets from one emitter
rather than a separate pipeline.
