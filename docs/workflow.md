## 🛑 Repository Conventions & Workflow Policy

1. **Squash Merge Only**: All pull requests must be merged into `main` using **Squash and Merge** exclusively.
2. **Delete Branch on Merge**: Feature branches must be automatically or manually deleted immediately upon merge into `main`.
3. **Linear History**: Maintain a strictly linear history. Rebase feature branches onto `main` before merging; no merge commits allowed.
4. **Publishing (npm, trusted publishing)**:
   - Stable releases publish automatically from pushes to `main` via `publish-package.yml`, using npm **Trusted Publishing** (OIDC) — no tokens anywhere. Bump `package.json` version in the PR; the workflow skips already-published versions.
   - Dev prereleases: comment **`/publish-dev`** on a PR to publish `<version>-dev.<pr>.<sha>` under the `dev` dist-tag (`publish-dev-command.yml` dispatches the trusted workflow on the PR branch). Consumers test with `pnpm add @rtkelly13/design-system@dev`.
   - The Tailwind contract consumers import is **`theme.css`** (`@theme` tokens, per-level and polarity variants, `@source`) — now **generated** from `src/theme/levels.ts`; `styles.css` layers fonts + global resets on top. There is no JS tailwind preset — do not reintroduce one.
5. **Visual Regression Testing** — the standards, the determinism contract and the operating instructions live in [`docs/visual-regression.md`](./visual-regression.md); these are the rules:
   - Powered by Playwright snapshot testing (`tests/visual.spec.ts`).
   - Runs strictly on **Linux CI** to avoid OS font rendering diffs. Tolerance is `maxDiffPixels: 0` — **but that is not zero tolerance**, and the distinction has already cost a missed regression. `maxDiffPixels` bounds how many pixels may *count* as different; `threshold`, left at Playwright's default of `0.2`, decides whether a pixel counts at all. A brand accent moving `#ec4899` → `#f955a4` scores 0.0023 in the YIQ space pixelmatch uses — 87× below the bar — and passed all 40 cases. See #125. It was `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05`, which let ~46,000 pixels of a 1280x720 shot differ freely and was only ever exercised against a placeholder image. Raise it only to the smallest number a real run demands, and say which story forced it.
   - **Clean URLs must stay off in the static server.** `serve` enables them by default, which 301s `/iframe.html?id=<story>` to `/iframe` and **drops the query string**. Storybook then has no story to select and renders its "No Preview" placeholder — and because `--update-snapshots` will happily bake that placeholder in as the baseline, the whole suite silently passes while testing nothing. That is exactly what happened up to `0.0.5`: all five baselines were the same error page. Both Playwright configs therefore pass `--config ../serve.json`, which sets `cleanUrls: false`; see "`serve.json` is load-bearing" below. `tests/story-ready.ts` is the second line of defence, asserting on Storybook's `sb-show-main` / `sb-show-nopreview` / `sb-show-errordisplay` body classes so a non-render fails loudly rather than being screenshotted.
   - Run manual snapshot updates via GitHub Actions `Update Visual Regression Snapshots` workflow (dispatch it on your branch; it commits regenerated baselines back to that branch — this repo blocks Actions from creating PRs).
   - **The update runs in `missing` mode by default**, writing only baselines that do not exist. That matters: a bare `--update-snapshots` presets to `changed`, so a run intended to add one new story would also re-record every baseline whose render had drifted — which is exactly how a regression becomes the expectation. Say **`/update-snapshots all`** (or `changed`) when a change is *meant* to alter rendering; the mode is echoed back in the PR comment so a reviewer can tell "two added" from "everything re-recorded".
   - Note that the snapshot workflow pushes as `github-actions[bot]`, and CI runs on bot-authored commits land in **`action_required`** — they need an "Approve and run" click before the PR shows a green check.
6. **Required Checks** — all of these run on every PR, spread across three
   parallel jobs in `ci.yml`; see § *CI Shape* for which job runs what and why.
   Branch protection requires the single aggregate check named **`ci`** (the
   `verify` job), which passes only if all three jobs do. That name is
   deliberately content-free, and **must stay that way**: the string is what
   branch protection and `shared-utilities`' governance map match on. It used to
   list what CI did, and splitting the single job into three silently rewrote it
   — the map went on requiring a job that no longer reported, so every PR failed
   `repo-governance verify-pr-checks` with all seven checks green. Rename the
   three jobs below freely; never rename `ci`:
   - `pnpm tokens:check` (theme.css matches `src/theme/levels.ts`)
   - `pnpm check:contrast` (every role pair, every level)
   - `pnpm lint` (colour-instead-of-role, reported at the site)
   - `pnpm check:css` (styling-in-CSS ratchet)
   - `pnpm check:deps` (dependency reasons, sections and usage)
   - `pnpm check:visual-coverage` (every story asserted or excluded with a reason)
   - `pnpm typecheck`
   - `pnpm test` (unit — see "Unit Tests" below)
   - `pnpm build`
   - `pnpm check:api` (the published type surface matches `api/index.d.ts`)
   - `pnpm build-storybook`
   - `pnpm test:visual` (Linux CI)
7. **New Components Need Baselines**: adding a story without a snapshot leaves
   `test:visual` unable to assert it. Add the story and its `CASES` row, comment
   **`/update-snapshots`** on the PR to generate the baseline, then push.
   `missing` mode writes only what does not exist, so this cannot re-record an
   existing baseline that has drifted.
   Note that Playwright reports a test that *creates* a baseline as failed, on
   purpose — `missing` mode attaches a soft error so a new baseline is never
   silent. So the update workflow's generate step is expected to exit non-zero
   whenever it does its job, and tolerates it; the **verify** step that follows,
   which re-runs the suite with no update flag, is the gate that decides whether
   the baselines get committed.
   This is not a convention you have to remember: `pnpm check:visual-coverage`
   reads Storybook's own build index and fails when a **component** has no
   asserted story and no `EXCLUDED` entry giving a reason. The budget is **0** and
   should stay there.
   It counts components, not stories, and that distinction is the rule: the suite
   asserts **one representative story per component**, because every row is a
   committed PNG a human reviews whenever it changes, so breadth across
   components is worth more than depth within one. A second story on a covered
   component is therefore free — the old story-counting budget got angrier at it
   while coverage improved not at all. It also catches the reverse: an `id` in the
   spec that Storybook no longer builds, i.e. a test asserting nothing.
   `tests/visual.spec.ts` is a table for this reason — adding a component means
   adding a row, and the id appears exactly once.
8. **Re-baselining Happens In The PR**: any change that legitimately alters
   rendering turns the visual check red. Comment **`/update-snapshots`** on the
   PR — it regenerates on Linux, verifies the suite passes against the new
   baselines, commits them back to the branch, and reports what changed. No
   merge required. `workflow_dispatch` still works for baselining `main`.
   Caveat: the baseline commit is pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub does
   not start workflow runs from those pushes, so the PR's own visual check keeps
   its previous result until you re-run it or push again. The verification step
   inside the update run is what tells you the new baselines are good.
   Closing that last gap needs a push identity that is not `GITHUB_TOKEN` —
   designed, with the exact token to create, in
   [`docs/ci-dispatch-token.md`](./ci-dispatch-token.md). Not implemented;
   nothing reads `CI_DISPATCH_TOKEN` yet.
9. **Every CI Job Has A Ceiling, And Browser Installs Retry**: a job with no
   `timeout-minutes` inherits GitHub's six-hour default, and a run killed at
   that limit is reported as **`cancelled`**, not failed — a red mark that
   names no step and suggests someone pressed a button. That is exactly how
   `main` went red on `dafbc1f`: `playwright install --with-deps` hung on both
   `ci.yml` and `storybook-walkthrough.yml`, burned six hours each, and a
   manual re-run of the identical SHA passed in two minutes. So: every job
   carries a `timeout-minutes`, and the browser install goes through
   [`.github/actions/install-playwright`](../.github/actions/install-playwright/action.yml),
   which bounds each attempt with `timeout` and retries once. Use `pnpm exec`,
   never `npx`, for anything Playwright: `npx` falls back to fetching the
   latest published CLI, and a Playwright other than the lockfile's installs a
   different Chromium — which under `maxDiffPixels: 0` moves every baseline
   rather than failing loudly. Related: `if: always()` on an upload step also
   fires on cancellation, so paired with `if-no-files-found: error` it turns
   every cancelled run into a failing step. Use `if: success() || failure()`.
