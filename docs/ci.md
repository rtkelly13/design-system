# CI shape and the screenshot walkthrough

Which job runs what and why, and how to review what a change looks like.

## ⚙️ CI Shape

`ci.yml` runs **three jobs in parallel**, then a fourth that reports their
combined verdict.

**It runs on every pull request, whatever the base branch.** `pull_request` used
to carry `branches: [main]`, which filters on the PR's *base* — so a PR aimed at
another branch got no CI at all. Not a failure, not a pending check: nothing.
A stacked PR showed only the Vercel comment check and read as "no gates to run",
which is worse than a red one. `push` keeps its `main` filter, because that
trigger is the post-merge signal for the default branch specifically.

| Job | What it runs | Roughly | Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gates` | `tokens:check`, `check:contrast`, `lint`, `check:css`, `check:fonts`, `check:deps` | 30s | 10m |
| `unit` | `typecheck`, `test`, `build` | 35s | 10m |
| `visual` | `build-storybook`, `check:visual-coverage`, `test:visual` | 60s | 25m |
| `verify` | nothing — fails unless the three above succeeded | 10s | 5m |

**Check names are lowercase, snake_case, and at most two words**, taken from the
shared lexicon in `shared-utilities` (`ci`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `visual`,
`publish`, `format`, ...) — so the four jobs report as `lint`, `test`, `visual`
and `ci`. Names that describe their contents cannot also be stable contracts:
the required check used to be `Build, Typecheck, Storybook & Visual Regression`,
splitting the job silently made it `Build, Typecheck, Unit Tests, Storybook &
Visual Regression`, and the governance map went on requiring the old string.
`repo-governance check-names` now fails on a required check no job declares, and
warns on names that drift from the lexicon.

Only `visual` installs a browser, so only its ceiling has to clear
`install-playwright`'s retry budget (rule 9). Splitting the job is what let the
other three drop to a ceiling sized to their own work, instead of every gate
waiting out a browser-shaped timeout.

**Add a new gate to `gates` or `unit`, not to `visual`.** The visual job is the
critical path; the other two have headroom, and putting a check behind a browser
install and a screenshot suite is what made this slow in the first place. It was
one job of nineteen serial steps, and nothing in it needed to be serial — so
`lint`, the fastest and most frequently-failing check in the repo, reported after
everything else had also run.

**Where the time actually goes**, so the next person optimising this starts from
measurements rather than a guess:

- **The walkthrough is the long pole of the whole PR**, not `ci.yml` — one test
  per story, four captures each, and it grows by four screenshots per component.
- **Both Playwright suites are wait-bound, not CPU-bound.** They spend their time
  on page loads, `document.fonts.ready` and per-capture settle waits, so they
  scale past the core count. Worker counts in both configs are measured, with the
  tables in the config comments; the gated suite's is also a determinism claim
  and is evidenced in [`docs/visual-regression.md`](./visual-regression.md).
- **`.github/actions/setup`** is Node + pnpm + install, and nothing else. Use it
  rather than repeating the steps: a `pnpm install` that differs between the job
  that writes a baseline and the job that checks it is the one difference this
  repo can least afford. Browsers are **not** here — that is
  `install-playwright`, so only the two jobs that drive a browser pay for it.
- **`.github/actions/install-playwright` now caches the download** as well as
  bounding and retrying it (rule 9). 13 of that step's 25 healthy seconds were
  spent fetching ~300MB that never changes until the lockfile does, which is
  also why the cache keys on `pnpm-lock.yaml`: the browser revision is pinned by
  the Playwright version in there, so a lockfile change is exactly when a cached
  browser stops being the right one. Only the download half is cacheable — the
  `--with-deps` apt half installs outside the cached directory, so a cache hit
  still runs `install-deps`, through the same retry loop, since that reaches the
  network too. Assuming the runner image carries those libraries would trade a
  red required check for ten seconds.
- **`ci.yml` supersedes in-flight PR runs** (`concurrency`), as the walkthrough
  already did. The group includes the event name so rule 8's manual
  `workflow_dispatch` re-run is never cancelled by a push or queued behind one.

Not done, and the next lever if the story count doubles again: sharding the
walkthrough across runners with `--shard` and `merge-reports`. Worth roughly
another 30s, at the cost of a merge job and three times the runner minutes.


## 📸 Screenshot Walkthrough

`pnpm walkthrough` captures every Storybook story on **every level**
(derived from `THEME_LEVELS`, so a new rung widens the matrix automatically)
and publishes Playwright's own HTML report to
`walkthrough-report/`. CI attaches it as `storybook-walkthrough-<sha>` on every PR.

Download it, unzip, open `index.html` — it works straight from `file://`, no
server needed. `pnpm walkthrough:show` serves it locally.

It is **not** a gate. It asserts nothing about how things should look; it makes
what they *do* look like reviewable. Visual regression stays in `ci.yml`.

Its real value is breadth per level: it captures *every* story on every rung,
where the gated suite captures one representative per component.

The cross-level gap the gated suite used to have is closed —
`Foundations/Theme Ladder → AllLevels` renders all four rungs in one screenshot
and is now a `CASES` row, so a token change that reads fine on `midnight` and is
unusable on `sketch` fails a required check rather than merely showing up in a
report nobody opened.

Two structural choices worth keeping:

- **One test per story, not per story-and-level.** The report lists tests, so a
  row is a component and opening it shows all four levels together — which is
  the comparison worth making. Splitting by level quadruples the rows and
  scatters the images that need comparing.
- **Each theme's capture is wrapped in a `test.step`.** Ungrouped, the
  navigation plumbing contributes ~21 rows to the step list and pushes the
  screenshots below the fold.

Note that `expect()`'s message argument becomes the *step title* in the report,
shown next to a green tick on success. `story-ready.ts` therefore raises its
guidance on catch instead — otherwise every passing run reads as a failure.

### Both suites verify the render first

`tests/story-ready.ts` asserts Storybook actually mounted the story before any
screenshot is taken, by checking the `sb-show-main` / `sb-show-errordisplay` /
`sb-show-nopreview` classes Storybook puts on `<body>`.

This is not optional defensiveness. Storybook always paints *something* — a
"No Preview" panel or a red error overlay — so a screenshot taken after a fixed
delay succeeds whether the story rendered or the entire preview bundle failed
to load. Every baseline in this repo was once a screenshot of the "No Preview"
panel, and the suite passed for as long as it kept being one.

### `serve.json` is load-bearing

`serve` rewrites `/iframe.html` to `/iframe` by default (`cleanUrls`), which
breaks Storybook's asset preloading and yields exactly that empty preview. Both
Playwright configs therefore start it as:

```
npx serve storybook-static -p 6006 --config ../serve.json
```

The path is relative to the **served directory**, not the repo root. Do not drop
the `--config` flag.
