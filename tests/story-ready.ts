 * Wait until a Storybook story has genuinely rendered, and fail loudly if it
 * has not.
 *
 * Storybook always paints *something* — a "No Preview" panel, or a red error
 * overlay — so a screenshot taken after a fixed delay succeeds whether the
 * story rendered or the whole preview bundle failed to load. Both the visual
 * regression baselines and the walkthrough report are therefore only meaningful
 * if the render is verified first; without this check a broken Storybook
 * produces a full set of confident-looking screenshots of an error message.
 *
 * Storybook signals its state through classes on `<body>`:
 *   sb-show-main            story rendered
 *   sb-show-nopreview       no story resolved for the id
 *   sb-show-errordisplay    the story or the preview bundle threw
