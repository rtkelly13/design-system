/**
 * Screenshot walkthrough of every Storybook story, in every theme.
 *
 * This is **not** a visual regression suite — it asserts nothing and has no
 * baselines. It produces a reviewable artifact: Playwright's HTML report, with
 * each story's three themes attached side by side, so a change to a shared
 * token can be eyeballed across the whole system rather than inferred from a
 * pixel-diff percentage.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `visual.spec.ts`, which does have baselines and
 * must stay a pass/fail gate. Mixing them would mean either this suite blocks
 * merges on cosmetic churn, or that one stops gating.
 *
 * One test per *story* rather than per story-and-theme: the report lists tests,
 * so this way a row is a component and opening it shows every level together —
 * which is the comparison worth making. Splitting by level would give four
 * times the rows and scatter the images that need comparing.
