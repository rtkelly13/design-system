# AGENTS.md

Foundational brutalist design system for ryankelly.dev and personal web applications (`@rtkelly13/design-system`, published to public npm).

Package manager is **pnpm** (`node >=22`).

## Commands

Everything is a `pnpm` script; these are the ones whose names do not give them away.

| | |
|---|---|
| `pnpm tokens:build` | regenerate `src/theme.css` from `src/theme/levels.ts` — **required after any colour change** |
| `pnpm tokens:check` | fail if that generated file is stale |
| `pnpm tokens:design` | regenerate `tokens/palette.<level>.tokens.json` — the DTCG export |
| `pnpm tokens:design:check` | fail if a token file is stale **or orphaned** |
| `pnpm check:contrast` | every role pair on every level, as arithmetic |
| `pnpm check:docs` | figures written in prose against the source they describe — `--list` for the census |
| `pnpm check:doc-snippets` | props and level names in documentation code fences against `api/index.d.ts` |
| `pnpm check:component-docs` | every component carries a JSDoc — a ratchet, budget **18** |
| `pnpm check:licences` | every shipped package against `licenses.baseline.json`, default-deny |
| `pnpm check:lint-budget` | `react-hooks`, `jsx-a11y` and `no-explicit-any` as a per-rule ratchet |
| `pnpm check:api` | the built type surface against the committed `api/index.d.ts` |
| `pnpm check:governance` | the repo's own rules: pinned SHAs, job ceilings, every gate wired, `rule N` resolving — `--list` for the census |
| `pnpm check:visual-coverage` | every component has an asserted story, or a stated reason |
| `pnpm check:docgen-props` | every documented component publishes its props table |
| `pnpm check:story-conventions` | story title vocabulary, and an autodocs decision per component |
| `pnpm check:deployed` | the live Storybook against this build — deliberately **not** a PR gate |
| `pnpm check:tokens` | hue-named call sites, budget **0** — a colour is addressed by its job |
| `pnpm ansi:check` | terminal slot coverage **and** the committed fixture diff |
| `pnpm test:visual` | Playwright snapshots — **Linux only**, see [`docs/visual-regression.md`](./docs/visual-regression.md) |
| `pnpm test:a11y` | axe over every asserted story, on both Levels |
| `pnpm walkthrough` | screenshot every story on every level, for review rather than assertion |

`pnpm lint` reports colour literals at the site that wrote them. `pnpm check:deps`,
`pnpm check:css` and `pnpm check:fonts` are ratchets with stated budgets.

## The four rules that are not discoverable

Everything else here you can find by reading the code. These four you cannot, and each has
cost real time:

1. **`src/theme.css` is generated.** `src/theme/levels.ts` is the only place a level name or a
   level colour is written. Edit that, run `pnpm tokens:build`, commit both.
2. **A token varies by Level or by Medium, never both.** Colour varies by Level and is picked at
   runtime; geometry and time vary by Medium and are picked at build time. `src/theme/media.ts`
   is the second axis, `theme.css` carries only the `web` Medium, and the prefixes do not
   overlap — `--ds-text-primary` is an ink, `--ds-type-body` is a size. See
   [`docs/adr/0004-two-axes-level-and-medium.md`](./docs/adr/0004-two-axes-level-and-medium.md).
3. **Colours are addressed by role, never by hue.** A component says `bg-surface-raised` or
   `text-intent-danger`, not `cyan`. See
   [`docs/adr/0001-hues-declared-below-roles.md`](./docs/adr/0001-hues-declared-below-roles.md)
   for why a hue layer exists anyway, and why components still may not touch it.
4. **There is exactly one primitive library, and it is `@base-ui/react`.** Adopt no second one —
   two focus-management implementations in one tree is worse than either alone, and this rule is
   what bounds the churn the choice accepts. A component that needs a primitive reaches for Base
   UI or hand-rolls it; it never brings in a package that carries its own. That bars `radix-ui`
   and anything depending on it, which includes `cmdk` (16 `@radix-ui/*` packages transitively).
   `@tanstack/react-table` is the stated exception and not a counter-example: it is a state
   engine with no DOM, no focus model and no ARIA, which is why `DataTable` writes its own.

## 🛑 Repository Conventions & Workflow Policy

Rule statements only. The reasoning, and the incidents that produced each one, are in
[`docs/workflow.md`](./docs/workflow.md) — read that before changing any of them.

**The numbering is shared.** Rule *n* here is rule *n* there, and workflow comments cite rules
by number. The two lists had drifted to eleven rules and nine, which silently re-pointed every
citation — nine sites cited "rule 9" for the timeout ceiling while rule 9 here was *Publishing*.
`pnpm check:governance` now fails if the numbers or the titles disagree, or if a `rule N`
citation names a rule that does not exist.

1. **Squash Merge Only**: all pull requests merge into `main` using **Squash and Merge**.
2. **Delete Branch on Merge**: feature branches are deleted immediately on merge.
3. **Linear History**: rebase onto `main` before merging; no merge commits.
4. **Publishing**: stable releases publish from `main` via npm Trusted Publishing — no tokens. Bump `package.json` in the PR. Comment `/publish-dev` for a prerelease.
5. **Visual Regression Testing**: Playwright snapshots, **Linux CI only**, `maxDiffPixels: 0` — and this suite does **not** gate colour; arithmetic does.
6. **Required Checks**: branch protection requires the single aggregate check named **`ci`**. That name is content-free and **must stay that way** — `shared-utilities` governance matches on the string.
7. **New Components Need Baselines**: a story without a snapshot asserts nothing. `pnpm check:visual-coverage` is the gate, and its budget is **0**.
8. **Re-baselining Happens In The PR**: comment `/update-snapshots` — say `all` when the change is *meant* to alter rendering, and name the story that forced it.
9. **Every CI Job Has A Ceiling**: every job carries `timeout-minutes`, browser installs go through `./.github/actions/install-playwright`, and an upload step uses `if: success() || failure()`, never `always()`.
10. **Direct Push Protection**: direct pushes to `main` are blocked; PRs required.
11. **Local Temp & Worktree Directory**: temporary files, local databases, scratch files and git worktrees go in the root `/temp/` directory (gitignored).
12. **Gitignored Local TODO File**: a root `TODO.md` file MUST exist for local task tracking and be gitignored.
13. **Auto-Merge Enabled**: PRs may enable auto-merge (squash).
14. **Pinned Action SHAs**: workflows MUST use 40-character commit SHAs with the version in a trailing comment, not mutable tags. `pnpm check:governance` enforces it.
