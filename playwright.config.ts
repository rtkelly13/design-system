  // runner's four cores idle for 36 seconds:
  //

  // `maxDiffPixels: 0` means any rendering that varies with how busy the machine
  // is would show up as a failed pixel diff. Baselines were generated at one
  // worker and the suite re-run against them seven times at two, four and six
  // workers on a four-core Linux box: byte-identical every time. That is the
  // expected result and worth stating why — nothing screenshotted here depends
  // on wall-clock time. `animations: 'disabled'` finishes transitions rather
  // than waiting them out, `story-ready.ts` awaits `document.fonts.ready` and a
  // verified render before anything is captured, and the viewport is fixed. A
  // slower worker gets the same pixels, later.
  //
  // Four rather than six — six measured a further second, which is not worth
  // spending the per-test timeout headroom on a gate that blocks merges.
  //
  // If this ever does produce a diff that a re-run does not reproduce, the fix
  // is this line back to 1, and the finding belongs in the determinism contract
  // in `docs/visual-regression.md` — a real non-determinism found here is worth
  // more than the 24 seconds.

      // 46,000 pixels of a 1280x720 shot, a region roughly 215x215, and
      // proportionally more on the `fullPage` rows. A component could change
      // colour, or a badge disappear, and the required check would pass. That
      // number was set when all five baselines were the same placeholder error
      // page, so it was never exercised against an image that could change.
      //
      // An absolute count rather than a ratio: it means the same thing on a
      // 1280x720 shot and a five-screen `fullPage` one, where a ratio silently
      // grants the tall images a much larger budget — exactly backwards, since
      // the big compositions are where a small regression hides.

      // `threshold` is Playwright's default 0.2, written out rather than
      // absent — because the absence read as "no allowance" and there is one,
      // and because the alternative was measured and does not exist.
      //
      // `maxDiffPixels` bounds how many pixels may *count* as different;
      // `threshold` decides whether a pixel counts at all, as a normalised YIQ
      // distance. So the two are not the same knob and 0 on one does not imply
      // 0 on the other.
      //
      // ## Why not `threshold: 0`
      //
      // Tried, on a branch, which is the only way to know. **21 snapshots
      // failed on unchanged code**, from 10 differing pixels to 11,274. So
      // anti-aliasing does produce differing pixels on a pinned Chromium — the
      // comment this replaces was right to be wary of tightening it.
      //
      // ## Why no other number works either
      //
      // The interesting part. To catch a real regression — `midnight`'s
      // accent.tertiary moving #ec4899 -> #f955a4, a brand accent shifting
      // across every component that draws it — the threshold must be below
      // **0.0023**. To absorb a 10% anti-aliasing shift on a high-contrast edge
      // (neon green on near-black, ink on paper) it must be above **0.0042**.
      //
      // Those overlap. **No threshold separates anti-aliasing noise from a
      // small colour change**, because an AA pixel on a high-contrast edge
      // travels further in YIQ than a subtle recolour does. This is not a
      // tuning problem with a better answer somewhere.
      //
      // ## What follows from that
      //
      // The visual suite is structurally unable to police colour, and must not
      // be relied on for it. That is why `auditHueAgreement` in
      // `src/theme/contrast.ts` exists as arithmetic and runs inside
      // `check:contrast`: a Role drifting from its Hue is caught by comparing
      // values, not by comparing pixels.
      //
      // The division of labour, stated so nobody re-litigates it: **arithmetic
      // gates colour; this suite gates structure** — an element moving,
      // disappearing, changing size, or a layout reflowing. It catches a large
      // colour change too (a #00ff00 probe failed four snapshots), but that is
      // a bonus and not the contract. See #125.
