 * `next/link`, in the shape the package's `LinkProvider` asks for. Every
 * internal link the design system renders — sidebar, pager, header brand, nav
 * items — goes through this, so navigation is client-side and prefetched, and
 * `next/link` adds the `/site` basePath.
 *
 * Storybook links are the exception. They are root-relative (`/?path=…`)
 * because Storybook is served from the same deployment, one level up, so they
 * must reach the browser exactly as written: through `next/link` they would
 * gain the basePath and route to a page this app does not have.
