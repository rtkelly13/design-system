/**
 * The rules that say a colour must be addressed as a role.
 *
 * These live here, in one place, because two very different things enforce them:
 *
 *   - `scripts/check-tokens.mjs` runs them over `src/components` and
 *     `src/stories` as a **ratchet**. Those files carry pre-existing debt, so
 *     each rule has a budget and CI fails only when a number rises.
 *   - `src/report/lint.ts` runs them over a report's TSX at **budget zero**. A
 *     report is new code written today; there is no debt to grandfather, and a
 *     hex literal in one renders identically on `midnight` and on `white`, which
 *     is the whole failure the ladder exists to prevent.
 *
 * The check script imports this `.ts` file directly — Node strips the types.
 * That is worth preserving: the previous arrangement had the rules written out
 * in a script, so anything else wanting them had to copy the regexes, and a copy
 * is a rule that silently stops matching the original.
