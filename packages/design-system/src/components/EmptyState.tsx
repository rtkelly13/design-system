 * compositional on purpose: an icon, a title, a description, an action slot,
 * all optional but the title. A fixed "No results found" component is one
 * product's empty state with its copy hoisted into a prop, and it is wrong for
 * the second consumer on the day they install it.
 *
 * ## The two empties are not the same state
 *
 * A search that matched nothing and an application with nothing in it look
 * alike and read completely differently. The first is *your query*, and the
 * action is to widen or clear it; the second is *the beginning*, and the action
 * is to create the first thing. Same component, different copy and a different
 * action — which is the argument for the slots.
 *
 * ## The title is a paragraph, not a heading
 *
 * Deliberate. This drops into a card body, a table, a panel, a dialog; the
 * right heading level is different in each and the component cannot know it.
 * A wrong level is worse than none — it breaks the document outline a screen
 * reader user navigates by. Where the empty state *is* the section, put a
 * `PageTitle` or a heading above it and let this one carry the prose.
