/**
 * The form's errors, gathered in one place at the top of the form, each a
 * link to the field it is about.
 *
 * Field-level `error` says what is wrong with *this* field, where the reader
 * already is. After a failed submit the reader is at the button, and a long
 * form's errors are scattered above them, some off-screen. This is the list
 * they start from: one heading saying that something is wrong, one line per
 * error, and each line takes them to the control — focus moves to it, and its
 * label scrolls into view.
 *
 * ## How it is announced: focus, not `role="alert"`
 *
 * When the summary appears it moves focus to itself (`tabIndex={-1}`), and it
 * is a `section` named by its heading, so a screen reader announces "There is
 * a problem, region" and reads on into the list. That is one deliberate
 * choice, made instead of a live region:
 *
 * - Focus puts the reader *where the fixes are*. The next Tab is the first
 *   error's link. An alert is read out and leaves the reader at the submit
 *   button with the list somewhere above them.
 * - Doing both double-announces: the alert fires and the focus change reads
 *   the same content again.
 *
 * So there is no `role="alert"` here, and `focusOnAppear` is on by default. It
 * fires when `errors` goes from empty to non-empty. A second failed submit
 * while errors are still listed does not re-fire it; remount the summary with
 * a `key` that changes per submit attempt, or call `focus()` on its ref.
 *
 * It holds no copy of its own beyond the default heading, and renders nothing
 * when `errors` is empty.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ErrorSummary
 *   key={attempt}
 *   errors={[
 *     { id: 'display-name', message: 'Enter a display name' },
 *     { id: 'terms', message: 'Accept the terms to continue' },
 *   ]}
 * />
 * ```
