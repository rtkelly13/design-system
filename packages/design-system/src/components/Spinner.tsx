 * A square that turns. No radius, no arc, no gradient — the mark is the border
 * of a box with one edge picked out in the accent, which is the same treatment
 * `Card` and `Button` give an edge and the only rotation in the package.
 *
 * `border-t-current` rather than a second accent map: the accent is already on
 * the element as a colour, so the leading edge inherits it and the eight roles
 * stay one table in `accentClasses`. `border-edge-subtle` is the rest of the
 * box, so the mark reads as a ring at rest rather than as three missing sides.

 *
 * ## It announces itself
 *
 * The wrapper is `role="status"` and carries a visually hidden `label`, so the
 * wait is spoken rather than merely drawn. A spinner announced as nothing is a
 * spinner a screen reader user sits through in silence, and `role="status"` is
 * a polite live region — it interrupts nothing, and it is read when the region
 * appears. That is why the label lives in the DOM as text rather than as an
 * `aria-label` on an empty element: text in a live region is announced on
 * insertion, and an attribute on an empty node is not reliably.
 *
 * The mark itself is `aria-hidden`. It is the same fact twice otherwise, once
 * as a name and once as an unlabelled box.
