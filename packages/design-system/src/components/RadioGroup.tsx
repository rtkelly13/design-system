 * and the invalid state, `helperText` gives way to it — and the only thing
 * this adds is what makes a set of options a *choice*: Base UI's `RadioGroup`
 * is rendered as the fieldset itself, so one element carries
 * `role="radiogroup"`, the legend's `aria-labelledby`, the group's
 * `aria-describedby` and the roving focus.
 *
 * That focus model is the difference from "several radios sharing a `name`":
 * Tab enters the group once, at the selected option or the first enabled one,
 * and leaves it on the next Tab; the arrow keys move *and select* within the
 * set, wrapping at either end.
 *
 * Reach for it for two to about seven mutually exclusive options that should
 * all be visible at once. Many more is a `Select`; a yes/no is a `Checkbox`.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <RadioGroup legend="Preferred deployment" name="deployment" defaultValue="self-hosted">
 *   <Radio value="cloud" label="Cloud" />
 *   <Radio value="self-hosted" label="Self-hosted" />
 *   <Radio value="hybrid" label="Hybrid" />
