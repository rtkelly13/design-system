/**
 * A destructive-action confirmation, on Base UI's `alert-dialog`.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `Modal` with different buttons
 *
 * The difference is the dismissal contract, and it is the whole point.
 * `AlertDialog` cannot be dismissed by clicking outside it: Base UI's
 * `AlertDialog.Root` omits `disablePointerDismissal` from its props
 * altogether, because the answer is never "yes". A confirmation you can
 * dismiss with a stray click is a confirmation that has not confirmed
 * anything, and shipping `Modal` without this is how a delete dialog ends up
 * backdrop-dismissible by default.
 *
 * Escape still closes it. That is deliberate and not a contradiction: Escape
 * is deliberate, unambiguous and always means *cancel*, and removing it would
 * trap a keyboard user in the dialog.
 *
 * It renders `role="alertdialog"` rather than `role="dialog"`, which is what
 * tells a screen reader to announce the whole surface rather than just its
 * name — the reason the description below is wired rather than decorative.
 *
 * ## The cancel control is the close control
 *
 * There is no `×`. A confirmation asks a question with two answers and both
 * are buttons; adding a third dismissal affordance in the corner makes the
 * safe answer ambiguous. Cancel is `AlertDialog.Close`, so it is also what a
 * touch screen reader finds when it looks for the way out.
