/**
 * The tab model this package has proven, promoted out of the one component
 * that had it.
 *
 * `CodeTabs` carried a hand-rolled tablist — roving `tabIndex`, arrow keys with
 * wrapping, `Home`/`End`, `aria-controls`/`aria-labelledby` pairing and the
 * three ARIA roles — behind ten tests, and none of it was reachable by a
 * consumer. This is that implementation, extracted rather than rewritten, so
 * the behaviour a consumer gets is the behaviour that was already asserted.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** a wrapper over `@base-ui/react/tabs`: #163
 * proposed that migration and was closed as rejected, because Base UI does not
 * implement typeahead either and the move would have cost the `keepMounted`
 * behaviour that puts every panel in the HTML. There is one tablist in this
 * tree, and this is it.
 *
 * Typeahead is still the one genuine gap, still out of scope here, and still
 * cheapest as an addition to `moveBetweenTabs` below.
