/**
 * Transient notifications — a queue, a live region and a lifetime.
 *
 * Mount one near the root of the application. Anything below it calls
 * {@link useToast} and `show()`s a toast; nothing renders a toast directly,
 * because a toast is not a place in the layout. It is not a `Card` with
 * `position: absolute` either, and the difference is the whole component:
 *
 * ## The live region exists before anything is in it
 *
 * The provider renders its region on mount, empty. A live region inserted at
 * the same moment as its content announces nothing, so a toast system that
 * creates its container when the first toast fires has a first toast nobody
 * hears. `info`, `success` and `warning` are announced politely from that
 * region. `danger` is assertive: it is copied into a `role="alert"` — the one
 * role defined to announce on insertion — so it interrupts, and it is marked
 * hidden in the polite region so it is not read twice.
 *
 * ## The lifetime yields to the reader
 *
 * Every timer pauses while the pointer is over the stack or focus is inside
 * it, and resumes when both leave — so a toast cannot expire while it is
 * being read, or out from under the pointer on its way to the action. The
 * default lifetime is a floor that long text raises, and a toast with an action
 * does not expire at all unless the caller says it should. F6 moves focus
 * into the stack from anywhere on the page, and Tab moves through the toasts
 * and their controls; Escape dismisses the focused one.
 *
 * ## The queue
 *
 * Several toasts at once stack newest first. Past `limit` the oldest are held
 * back — hidden and inert, not discarded — and return as the ones ahead of
 * them close.
 *
 * All of the above is `@base-ui/react/toast`, and this file is its only
 * wrapper: the surface, the intents and the lifetime policy are this
 * package's, the queue, timers and announcements are the primitive's.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <ToastProvider>
 *   <App />
 * </ToastProvider>
 *
 * const toast = useToast();
 * toast.show({ intent: 'success', title: 'Saved', description: 'Draft saved 12:04.' });
 * ```
