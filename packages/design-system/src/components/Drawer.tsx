/**
 * An edge-anchored dialog — the off-canvas primitive.
 *
 * A drawer is a dialog with a different position and a different transition,
 * and this component is written to make that literally true. It is
 * `@base-ui/react/dialog`, the same primitive `Modal` is built on, wearing
 * `dialogSurface`'s `placement` variant. Nothing about stacking, dismissal,
 * focus or scroll locking is implemented here, because all four already exist
 * one layer down and a second implementation of any of them would be a second
 * answer to a question this system has already answered.
 *
 * ## What it inherits, and why that is the whole point
 *
 * - **The dialog stack.** A drawer over a `Modal`, or an `AlertDialog` over a
 *   drawer, resolves through Base UI's stack: Escape closes the topmost
 *   surface only. That invariant arrived with #162 and is asserted again in
 *   `Drawer.test.tsx` — not because it could plausibly differ, but because
 *   the whole overlay set now depends on it and a test is what keeps it true
 *   when the next surface is added.
 * - **Focus.** It moves into the panel on open, is trapped while open, and
 *   returns to the invoker on close. As in `Modal`, `initialFocus` points at
 *   the popup rather than its first tabbable child, so a screen reader
 *   announces the drawer's own title instead of "Close drawer, button".
 * - **The background, hidden from assistive technology.** Base UI marks the
 *   portal's siblings `aria-hidden` while the drawer is open.
 * - **The scroll lock.** `overflow-y: hidden` on `body` with
 *   `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on `html`, so the page behind does not jump by
 *   the width of its scrollbar when the drawer opens.
 *
 * ## What is its own
 *
 * The position and the transition, both from the recipe. The panel is full
 * height against one edge, bordered on its inner side only, and enters by
 * translating in from off-screen via `data-starting-style` /
 * `data-ending-style` over `--duration-quick` and `--ease-brutalist`.
 * `motion-reduce:transition-none` drops the movement entirely: a panel flying
 * across the viewport is precisely the motion `prefers-reduced-motion` asks
 * not to see, and the drawer still opens and closes without it.
 *
 * ## Why it is not `Modal` with a prop
 *
 * It nearly is, and that was considered. The difference is the *shape of the
 * API a caller wants*: a drawer is sized by its edge and its width, a modal by
 * its width alone; a drawer's `placement` is meaningless on a modal, and a
 * modal's centring is meaningless on a drawer. Keeping them separate leaves
 * both prop lists honest while the surface underneath stays single — which is
 * the same trade `AlertDialog` made against `Modal`, for the same reason.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
 *
 * <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>MENU</Button>
 * <Drawer isOpen={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} placement="left" title="Navigation">
 *   <nav>…</nav>
 * </Drawer>
 * ```
