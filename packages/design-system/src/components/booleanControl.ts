/**
 * The surface a boolean control wears, in its two presentations.
 *
 * `Checkbox` and `Switch` are one capability — a boolean — drawn twice (and
 * `Radio` is one option of a set, drawn a third time), so the
 * border weight, the checked fill, the disabled treatment and the invalid
 * border are declared **once** and selected by `shape`. Two recipes would
 * drift, and the drift would show up as a switch that disagrees with the
 * checkbox beside it about what "disabled" looks like.
 *
 * A module of its own for the reason `dialogSurface.ts` gives: `src/index.ts`
 * re-exports the component files wholesale, and a `recipe` in the published
 * surface puts `tailwind-variants`' types back into the `.d.ts`.
 *
 * Every state here is a Base UI data attribute — `data-checked`,
 * `data-indeterminate`, `data-disabled`, `data-invalid` — so nothing in the
 * components computes a class from a prop. `data-invalid` in particular is
 * inherited from the enclosing `Field.Root`, which is what makes an error on
 * the field visible on the control without either being told about the other.
 *
 * No focus class. The global `:focus-visible` outline in `styles.css` is the
 * ring, and a component-level override is exactly the #44 regression that rule
 * exists to prevent.
