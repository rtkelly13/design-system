/**
 * Every dependency is declared in the right place, actually used, and has a
 * stated reason.
 *
 * `knip` already answers "is this package imported anywhere" for JS and TS, and
 * it is better at that than anything hand-rolled — so this does not duplicate
 * it. What it adds is the two things knip cannot:
 *
 *   1. **A reason.** Nothing off-the-shelf enforces that a dependency is
 *      justified. Every entry in `package.json` must appear in MANIFEST below
 *      with a `kind` and a `why`, and every MANIFEST entry must still be
 *      declared — so a package cannot arrive without an explanation, and the
 *      explanation cannot outlive the package.
 *   2. **The CSS surface.** `styles.css` does `@import "tailwindcss"` and
 *      `prose.css` does `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"`. Those resolve from
 *      the *consumer's* node_modules at their build time, which makes them real
 *      dependencies of this package's CSS contract — and knip does not parse
 *      Tailwind at-rules, so it reports the typography plugin as unused. It is
 *      not; it is invisible.
 *
 * It also checks the placement rule that actually bites: a package imported from
 * shipped source must be a runtime or peer dependency, never a devDependency,
 * or the published package breaks on install.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-deps.mjs           verify

 * Packages imported from *shipped* source.

 * `src/stories/**` is excluded: those files sit under `src/` but are not
 * reachable from `src/index.ts`, so nothing they import reaches the bundle.
 * That is why Storybook can be a devDependency while living inside `src/`.
 *
 * Unit tests are excluded for exactly the same reason. Co-locating
 * `slug.test.ts` next to `slug.ts` is what makes the pairing obvious, but it
 * puts a `vitest` import under `src/` — and without this the check would read
 * that as the bundle depending on the test runner and demand it be promoted to
 * a runtime dependency, which is the opposite of correct.
 *
 * The exclusion is safe only because it is *also* true that nothing reachable
 * from the entrypoint imports a test file. `tsup` bundles from `src/index.ts`,
 * so a stray `export` from a `.test.ts` could not pull the runner into `dist`
 * without also appearing in the published types — which rule 5 below would
 * catch.
