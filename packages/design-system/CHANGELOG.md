# Changelog

Pre-1.0 and moving fast. **Every minor may break.** There are two consumers —
`rtkelly13/blog` and this package's own Storybook — both in the same estate and
migrated in the same change, so compatibility between 0.x versions buys nothing
and is not attempted: no deprecation shims, no alias layers, no staged removals.

Proper release notes start at 1.0. Until then this file records only what a
consumer has to *do*, newest first. The reasoning lives in the pull requests and
in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/).

## Unreleased

**ESM only.** The package is `"type": "module"` and ships one build: `dist/index.js` and one
`.js` file per module. The CommonJS build, `main` and `module` are gone, and `exports["."]` is
`{ types, default }`. No export was added or removed, and the CSS, token and terminal subpaths are
unchanged.

### You have to do something only if

- **You `require()` the package on Node older than 22.12.** That already failed on 0.12.0: the
  CommonJS build `require()`d `@microcharts/react`, which is ESM only, and Node before 22.12 throws
  `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` on it. 22.12 is the first release that loads an ES module from `require()`.
  Upgrade Node, or use `import`. On 22.12+ `require('@rtkelly13/design-system')` returns the same
  module `import` does.
- **A tool of yours needs the package to be CommonJS** — Jest without ESM support, say. Run it in
  ESM mode, or move it to Vitest.
- **You deep-imported a file under `dist/`.** Nothing documented one, but `dist/index.mjs` and
  every `dist/**/*.mjs` are now `.js`. Import from the package root.

Bundlers (Vite, Next, webpack, esbuild) resolved the `import` condition already and see no change.

## 0.12.0

New documentation visuals adapted from mdxcn: `ActivityGrid`, `GanttChart`,
`UptimeStrip`, `FlowDiagram`, `Timeline`, `TreeDiagram`, `ChangeSummary`, and
`BeforeAfter`. `Steps` and `Terminal` are available as unframed blocks. Wrap one
or more of them in `FigureFrame` when the content needs a shared caption and
border. Each adapted component links to its upstream source in its file header.

No mdxcn package dependency is required. Existing published components and
their props are unchanged.

## 0.11.0

`Select` themed on Base UI's select: the open list is painted by the Level, not the operating
system (#164). With it the last row of [`docs/capability-readiness.md`](./docs/capability-readiness.md)
is `ready`. Breaking only for `Select`: no export was added or removed, and the entry points,
dependencies and peer dependencies are the same as 0.10.0.

### You have to do something

- **`onChange(event)` is removed. Use `onValueChange(value: string)`.** It is called with the newly
  chosen option's `value` — a string, not a `ChangeEvent` — so `onChange={(e) => set(e.target.value)}`
  becomes `onValueChange={set}`. There is no alias and no shim.
- **`multiple` and `size` are removed.** `Select` chooses exactly one option from a closed list.
  Choosing several is `Checkbox`; showing a visible set is `RadioGroup`.
- **`value` and `defaultValue` are strings only.** `number` and `string[]` are no longer accepted.
  With neither given, the first enabled option is chosen, as on a native `<select>`; pass
  `placeholder` to start from nothing instead.
- **Options still come from `options`, never from children.** `children` is no longer part of
  `SelectProps` at all; `<option>` elements passed as children were never rendered and are now a
  type error. A row that cannot be chosen is `{ label, value, disabled: true }`.
- **The control is a button with `role="combobox"`, not a `<select>`.** `SelectProps` extends
  `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` instead of `SelectHTMLAttributes<HTMLSelectElement>`, and the ref
  (`Select` now forwards one) is the trigger. The field label is no longer a `<label>`: it names the
  trigger by `aria-labelledby`, and clicking it focuses the trigger without opening the list.
  Tests that drove it with `fireEvent.change` on a `<select>` should find it with
  `getByRole('combobox', { name })`, open it, and choose a row by `getByRole('option', { name })`.
- **If you need the platform picker, pass `native`.** It renders the `<select>` element, with the
  same props and the same `onValueChange` — not the removed native API.
- **A `name` still submits.** Base UI keeps a hidden input under `name`, so `FormData` carries the
  chosen `value` as before. `form` and `autoComplete` are now explicit props.

### Rendering changed

- **The closed `Select` gains a chevron, and its open list is drawn from roles** — `surface.raised`
  rows, an accent fill on the highlighted row, an accent `>` on the chosen one. The
  `errorsummary-account-settings*` baselines move with it, and `select-*` rows are new.

## 0.10.0

The capability release: every row in [`docs/capability-readiness.md`](./docs/capability-readiness.md)
but *Choose one* is `ready`, so a site can be built without inventing its own interaction
behaviour. The themed `Select` that finishes that row is a breaking change and follows in 0.11.0.

### You have to do something

- **Nothing, for imports.** No export was removed or renamed; 120 were added. The entry points,
  `files`, runtime dependencies and peer dependencies are the same as 0.9.0.
- **If you pass `BlogPost` an `author` string other than the default name**, the card now shows that
  author — their own initials, no description — instead of the default author's initials and bio.
  Pass a `BlogAuthor` object (`name`, `initials`, `avatar`, `url`, `description`) to describe them,
  or `authorCard` to replace the card. Omitting `author` is unchanged.
- **If you pass `SaasLandingPage` `deployLog=""`**, the terminal preview is now hidden, as the prop
  always documented.

### Rendering changed

- **`Pagination` renders a numbered page list** rather than previous/next alone.
- **A `DataTable` with `pageSize` now paginates:** one page of rows, with `Pagination` beneath when
  there is more than one page. It also renders `caption`, row headers, `scope` and `aria-sort`.
- **Portalled surfaces follow a scoped `ThemeProvider`.** `Modal`, `AlertDialog`, `Drawer`, `Toast`,
  `Tooltip`, `Popover` and `Menu` rendered inside `<ThemeProvider scoped>` take that provider's Level,
  not the document's. Under an unscoped provider nothing changes.
- **`SaasLandingPage`** is now composed from the marketing sections. Its prices use the display
  face (they had fallen back to the system sans-serif), and its grids drop to one column below `md`
  instead of overflowing a phone's width.

### New

- **Forms:** `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `Fieldset` + `Legend`, `RadioGroup` + `Radio`, and
  `ErrorSummary` — a form-level summary that links to each invalid field and takes focus when it
  appears.
- **Feedback:** `Spinner`, `Skeleton`, `Progress`, `EmptyState`, and `ToastProvider` / `useToast`.
- **Overlays:** `Drawer`, `Tooltip`, `Popover` and `Menu`, all on Base UI.
- **Navigation:** `Tabs`, `SiteHeader` (skip link, breakpoint swap), `SiteNav` + `SiteNavItem`,
  `MobileNav` and `SiteFooter`, with `LinkProvider` / `SiteLink` to inject a router's link and its
  current-route test once. `DocsLinkProvider` keeps its API and now shares that context.
- **Layout:** `AppShell` with `AppSidebar`, `AppSidebarNav`, `AppTopbar` and `AppMain`.
- **Marketing:** `Hero`, `FeatureGrid` + `Feature`, `PricingGrid` + `PricingTier`, `CTASection`.
- **Reports:** `ReportDocument`, `ReportSection`, `ReportDetails`.
- **`BlogPost`:** `BlogAuthor` and the `authorCard` slot.

### Fixed

- `Input`, `TextArea` and `Select` merge a caller's `style` with the accent instead of losing it.
- `TextArea` and `Select` put their `id` on the control, so the label's `for` points at it and a
  click on the label focuses the field.
- `Card` forwards its ref.
## 0.9.0

`Modal` on Base UI's dialog, and the `AlertDialog` that had to ship with it.

### You have to do something

- **Nothing, if you only render `Modal`.** `ModalProps` is unchanged — `isOpen`, `onClose`,
  `title`, `children`, `footer`, `closeOnBackdropClick`, `className` all mean what they meant.
  `Modal` now also forwards a ref and spreads unrecognised props onto the dialog.
- **If you targeted `[data-slot="modal-backdrop"]` to position or size the dialog**, that element
  no longer wraps it. Base UI splits the one element into two: `modal-backdrop` is the dim,
  `modal-viewport` is the centring container and the dialog's parent. Styling the dim is unchanged;
  anything about layout moves to `modal-viewport`.
- **If you asserted `aria-modal` on the dialog**, it is gone, and not by omission. Base UI marks the
  portal's siblings `aria-hidden` instead — the mechanism `aria-modal` is a hint for, and the one
  screen readers implement consistently. Assert the sibling marking, not the attribute.
- **If you tested backdrop dismissal with `mouseDown` alone**, send a pointer sequence
  (`pointerdown` then `click`). Base UI confirms an outside press rather than acting on the first
  event, which is closer to what a browser sends.

### Rendering changed

- **`Modal` gains a backdrop element and a viewport element**, and fades both on open and close via
  `data-starting-style` / `data-ending-style`, at `--ds-duration-quick`. The enter/exit is
  suppressed under `prefers-reduced-motion`. `modal-*` baselines move.
- **Focus lands on the dialog, not on its close button.** Unchanged in effect from the hand-rolled
  version, but it is now a deliberate `initialFocus` rather than a side effect of a `tabIndex={-1}`
  container.

### New

- **`AlertDialog`** — destructive confirmation. Same surface as `Modal`, different dismissal
  contract: a backdrop press *cannot* close it, Escape can, and there is no `×`. `onConfirm` is
  separate from `onClose`, so the two answers never collapse into one handler.

### Deleted

- `Modal`'s hand-rolled focus trap, capture-phase `document` Escape listener, `body.style.overflow`
  scroll lock and focus-return ref. With them go three defects: Escape closing two stacked dialogs
  at once, a focus boundary computed once from the first and last focusable node, and a page behind
  the dialog that was never hidden from assistive technology. The scroll lock also no longer shifts
  the page by the scrollbar's width.

## 0.7.0

The primitive layer, and four new gates.

### You have to do something

- **`@base-ui/react` is a runtime dependency.** Nine packages, all MIT. `Input`, `TextArea` and
  `Select` are built on its `Field` instead of a hand-rolled `useField()`; the props are unchanged.
  It is now the *only* permitted primitive library — rule 4 in `AGENTS.md` — which bars `radix-ui`
  and anything depending on it, `cmdk` included.
- **`BracketText` no longer accepts `accent="white"`.** Omit `accent` for the default ink. It was an
  appearance name in a component API, which ADR 0001 exists to prevent, and it outlived the hue
  vocabulary #138 removed because the union named it explicitly.
- **`AdminNavItem.icon` and `AdminStatusBadge.icon` take a component, not an element** —
  `LayoutDashboard`, never `<LayoutDashboard size={18} />`. Size travels as a `className`. This
  matches `PageHeader`, `StatCard` and `DocsHeader`, and it is what stopped Storybook's source
  generator throwing on those stories.

### Rendering changed

- **Code blocks are `text.primary`, not `intent.success`.** Every code block rendered in the
  "this worked" green, contradicting the `--tw-prose-pre-code` mapping eleven lines above it.
  6.02:1 → 13.63:1 on `sketch`.
- **`Modal` is above the docs header.** It was `z-50` against the header's `z-index: 60`, so a
  dialog painted *under* the page chrome it covers. Both now read the `--ds-layer-*` scale.
- **Three touch-device affordances stopped being dimmed.** `.docs-anchor-link`,
  `.docs-codeblock-copy` and `.docs-sidebar-link-static` addressed `text.muted` instead of an
  `opacity` on `text.primary` — 3.45:1 and 2.64:1 on `sketch`, permanently, on every touch device.
  `opacity` changes the foreground *after* `check:contrast` reads it.

### New

- **`Swatch` and `SwatchGroup`** — the package can draw its own palette outside a story file.
- `accentFillClass()`, joining `accentTextClass()` / `accentFocusClass()` / `accentHoverEdgeClass()`.
  All four accent-to-class maps are now one, in `lib/accentClasses`.
- **Four gates**: `check:doc-snippets` (props and level names in documentation code fences against
  `api/index.d.ts`), `check:component-docs` (every component carries a JSDoc — a ratchet at 18),
  plus `motion.transitions` and `motion.keyframes` claims in `check:docs`.
- `docs/deterministic-rendering.md` — the three switches that decide whether a capture reproduces.
  `scoped` is the one that does the work; `persist={false} followSystem={false}` look like the
  determinism controls and are redundant under it.
- `docs/research.md` — the outside reading, and what each idea changed here.
- Interaction baselines: `button-hover`, `button-pressed`, `input-keyboard-focus`. The focus one is
  the assertion `focus-ring.test.ts` says it cannot make.

### Fixed

- The keyboard focus ring survives on `Input`, `TextArea`, `Tag`, `Modal` and `CodeTabs` —
  `focus:outline-none` at (0,2,0) was beating the global `:focus-visible` at (0,1,0).
- `DocsHeader` and `AdminDashboardLayout` render without a `ThemeProvider` instead of throwing.
- `SectionContainer` merges a caller's `className` instead of appending it, so a conflicting
  utility now wins.
- `accent.quiet` is audited as a fill. 220 contrast pairs → 222.
- The README's integration snippet passed a prop that does not exist.

### Also in this release, landed after 0.6.0 published

Terminal schemes, and the second axis.

- **Terminal / ANSI ships.** `terminal/rtk-{midnight,sketch}.{itermcolors,windows-terminal.json,alacritty.toml,ghostty.conf}` — eight files, exported and packed. Four encodings of one fan-out, which is why terminal was the cheapest Target left.
- `pnpm ansi:build` / `ansi:check`. The check is **slot coverage plus a committed fixture diff** — the two gates ADR 0001 says a fan-out map requires, since a wrong map emits confidently: a terminal renders an unfilled slot as the foreground rather than erroring.
- `ANSI_SLOTS`, `SLOTS`, `ansiScheme` are public. The fan-out is data, so it is unit-tested.
- `allowImportingTsExtensions` in `tsconfig.json`, so a module can be imported by both `tsc` and a plain `.mjs` emitter without a workaround.

The second axis. Geometry and time are declared for the first time; ADRs 0001–0004 are accepted.

- **`Medium`** — `web`, `video`, `graphic`. A unit system and a time base, chosen at build time
  by which artifact is being emitted, where a Level is chosen at runtime. **No token varies on
  both axes.** `src/theme/media.ts`.
- `theme.css` carries exactly one Medium, `web`: `--ds-space-*`, `--ds-type-*`,
  `--ds-leading-*`, `--ds-weight-*`, `--ds-stroke-*`, `--ds-elev-*`, `--ds-radius-*`,
  `--ds-duration-*`, `--ds-ease`, `--ds-layer-*`, `--ds-focus-*`. 274 → 336 properties.
- **Prefixes do not collide across axes.** `--ds-text-*` is ink and `--ds-type-*` is size;
  `--ds-border-*` is colour and `--ds-stroke-*` is width. Renamed before shipping, not after.
- **Radius is a token, not a reset.** `*, *::before, *::after { border-radius: 0 !important }`
  is gone; Tailwind's whole radius scale is redefined to the Medium's value, so `rounded-lg` is
  square without this package touching a consumer's document. Closes #54.
- **The contrast floor is Medium-keyed.** `pnpm check:contrast` defaults to the web floors;
  `--medium=video` enforces the stricter frame ones, which the current palette does **not**
  clear — deliberately, since no video artifact is emitted yet.
- `video` is not the web scaled: its type steps are its own and its motion is whole frames.
  `graphic` has no time base at all.

## 0.6.0

The hue vocabulary is gone from the component API. Nothing addresses a colour by
its appearance any more.

- `LegacyAccent`, `brutalistTokens`, and the `--color-brutalist-*`,
  `--color-black` and `--color-white` compat aliases are **deleted**. 540
  emitted custom properties down to 250.
- `accent` / `variant` props take Roles only: `primary`, `secondary`,
  `tertiary`, `quiet` and the four intents. `cyan` → `primary`,
  `yellow` → `secondary`, `pink` → `tertiary`, `green` → `success`.
- Tailwind utilities: `bg-brutalist-cyan` → `bg-accent-primary`,
  `text-brutalist-pink` → `text-accent-tertiary`,
  `text-brutalist-yellow` → `text-accent-secondary`,
  `text-brutalist-neonGreen` → `text-intent-success`.
- CSS variables: `var(--brutalist-cyan)` → `var(--ds-accent-primary)`. Do not
  keep a hue-named fallback — it will be a dark value applied on a light theme.
- `PageHeaderAccent`, `CardAccent`, `TagAccent` deleted; use `AccentToken`.
- **Added** a glow per role — `--shadow-glow-accent-tertiary` and friends —
  because the compat layer's `glow-cyan` / `glow-pink` / `glow-orange` had no
  role-named equivalent. `shadow-glow-cyan` → `shadow-glow-accent-primary`,
  `shadow-glow-pink` → `shadow-glow-accent-tertiary`,
  `shadow-glow-orange` → `shadow-glow-accent-secondary`. Hard shadows were
  already role-named; the glows being hue-only was a symptom of the layer being
  removed.

## 0.5.0

Two themes, and a colour vocabulary underneath the semantic one.

- `THEME_LEVELS` is `['midnight', 'sketch']`. `dim`, `bright` and `white` are
  gone, and so is `levelsByPolarity`. `dim` → `midnight`;
  `bright` / `white` → `sketch`.
- `palette` and `paletteBright` — ten Hues per theme, gated at 5.5:1. Components
  address Roles; a Hue in component code is a defect.
- `accentHue` / `intentHue` declare which Hue each Role is, and
  `check:contrast` asserts they agree.
- `FIXED_COLOURS` — Level-invariant `black`, `white`, `transparent`.
- Design Tokens Format Module export at `tokens/palette.<level>.tokens.json`,
  OKLCH with an sRGB hex fallback.
- Themes are selected with `[data-theme="…"]`. A consumer applying them as a
  class only will match no theme block at all.
