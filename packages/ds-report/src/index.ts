/**
 * `@rtkelly13/ds-report` — a TSX file in, one self-contained HTML report out.
 *
 * A separate package on purpose. This needs esbuild, Tailwind's compiler and a
 * TypeScript compiler to do its job; none of that belongs in the dependency
 * graph of an app that installs the design system for its components. Keeping
 * them apart also lets each version on its own clock — a fix here is not a
 * release of the components, and the report is rendered against whichever copy
 * of `@rtkelly13/design-system` the report's own project installs.
