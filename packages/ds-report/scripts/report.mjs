/**
 * Runs the report CLI straight from `src/`, so a report can be rendered in this
 * repo without building first.
 *
 *   pnpm report path/to/report.tsx --theme midnight
 *
 * Consumers get the built `ds-report` bin instead. The one subtlety is *where*
 * the bundle is written: the renderer resolves
 * `@rtkelly13/design-system` from the *report's* directory, and the dev bundle
 * has to sit inside this package for that walk to reach the workspace's
 * node_modules. It is gitignored, and dot-prefixed so neither tsup, knip nor tsc
 * picks it up.
