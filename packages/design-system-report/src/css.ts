 * The stylesheet for one report: Tailwind, compiled against a known candidate

 * itself, and it hands back `sources` (this package's `@source "./"`) for the
 * caller to scan. We ignore that: `extractCandidates` already knows the answer,
 * so `build()` gets the exact list and the scanner never runs.
