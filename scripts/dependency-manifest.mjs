/**
 * Why every dependency exists, and where it belongs — the single copy.
 *
 * Extracted from `check-deps.mjs` so that `analyse-dep-cost.mjs` can join a
 * measured byte cost to the stated reason without either script owning half of
 * the answer. A dependency's reason and its price belong in one row; keeping
 * the reason here is what lets the cost report print them together instead of
 * asking a reader to hold two files in their head.
 *
 * `kind` is the section the package must be declared in:
 *   runtime — `dependencies`; shipped and imported by the compiled bundle
 *   dev     — `devDependencies`; build, test or docs tooling only
 *   peer    — `peerDependencies`; the consumer supplies it. Set `alsoDev` when
 *             this package needs its own copy to build and test against.
 *
 * Nothing runs on import. This file is data.
