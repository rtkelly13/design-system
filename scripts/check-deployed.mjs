/**
 * Is the deployed Storybook the one this repo builds?
 *
 * Production silently stopped updating. `Docs/CodeTabs` landed on 8 September in
 * #113 and was still absent from `design-system.ryankelly.dev` three days and
 * about thirty merged pull requests later — along with the whole Manifesto,
 * `Swatch`, `Card` and `DataTable`. 136 stories deployed against 168 built.
 *
 * Nothing reported it, and nothing could:
 *
 * - Vercel is **not** a required check, deliberately — it must never be able to
 *   block a merge. So its failures are advisory, and advisory red on every PR is
 *   red nobody reads.
 * - The failures were `build-rate-limit` on the account, which is not a code
 *   problem and does not look like one.
 * - Every gate in this repo verifies the tree. None of them looks at what is
 *   actually being served, which is #82's argument about theme artifacts
 *   arriving one layer up: a check that proves the source is right "would be
 *   equally happy with a generator that reproducibly emitted the wrong shape".
 *
 * ## Deliberately not a PR gate
 *
 * Production deploys *after* a merge, so on any PR this would compare a built
 * tree against a deployment that cannot include it yet, and fail every time. A
 * gate that is always red is a gate that gets removed.
 *
 * Run it on a schedule, or by hand when a deploy is in doubt.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-deployed.mjs            compare and report
 *   node scripts/check-deployed.mjs --strict   exit 1 on any drift
