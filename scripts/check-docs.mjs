/**
 * Do the figures written in prose still match the source they describe?
 *
 * `DESIGN.md` said the contrast gate audits **440 pairs** for four months. The
 * gate reported 220. Nothing was wrong with the gate, the palette or the docs
 * pipeline — the number was typed in the commit that collapsed four Levels to
 * two, was stale the moment it was written, and survived every review since
 * because nothing compares prose to arithmetic. It was found by accident, by
 * rendering the figure next to a live `auditContrast` call and seeing the two
 * disagree.
 *
 * This is that comparison, as a gate. Every claim below names a figure, how to
 * compute it from the source, and the phrasings that carry it. A number that
 * drifts now fails CI at the line that states it.
 *
 * ## What this does not do
 *
 * It checks **declared** figures at **declared** phrasings. It is not a promise
 * that every number in every document is verified — that would need prose to be
 * parsed rather than matched, and a gate that claims more than it checks is
 * worse than none. Two things keep it honest:
 *
 *   1. A claim whose patterns match nothing anywhere is reported as a failure,
 *      not skipped. So rewording a sentence out from under a pattern surfaces as
 *      "declared but not found" rather than as a silent pass — the failure mode
 *      that would otherwise turn this file into decoration.
 *   2. Every site is reported with its file and line, so `--list` is a census of
 *      exactly which sentences are covered.
 *
 * Adding a claim is the cost of writing a new figure into prose, and it is meant
 * to be: a number in a document is an assertion, and this is where it is made.
 *
 * ## Not yet covered, and why
 *
 * The OKLab ΔE figures — the 0.049 tightest pair, the 0.04 separation floor, the
 * 0.024 that dropped an eleventh Hue, and the hue angles in `ansi.ts` — are the
 * obvious next claims. `deltaE` currently exists only as a local helper inside
 * `src/theme/palette.test.ts`, so gating them here means either a third
 * implementation of OKLab in this repo, which is exactly the drift ADR 0001
 * rejects, or lifting that helper into `contrast.ts` as an export — an
 * API-surface change that belongs in its own commit with its own `check:api`
 * update. Left undone deliberately rather than done twice.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-docs.mjs           fail if a figure disagrees
 *   node scripts/check-docs.mjs --list    show every site, including the ones that agree
