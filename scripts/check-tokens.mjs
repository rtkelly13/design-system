/**
 * Count the call sites still addressing a colour by hue rather than by role.
 *
 * `scripts/build-tokens.mjs` has referenced this command since the compat
 * aliases were written — *"`pnpm check:tokens` counts the remaining call sites;
 * this block comes out when that reaches zero"* — and it did not exist. The exit
 * condition for deleting ~30 emitted aliases was therefore unmeasurable, so the
 * block sat there indefinitely. This is that command.
 *
 * A ratchet, not a ban, in the same family as `check:css` and `check:deps`. The
 * budget only ever goes down; a new hue-named call site fails the build with the
 * role it should have used.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-tokens.mjs           fail if the count rises
 *   node scripts/check-tokens.mjs --list    print every site
 *
 * ## What counts, and why the mapping is what it is
 *
 * `LegacyAccent` is `'cyan' | 'pink' | 'yellow' | 'green'`, and `LEGACY_VARS`
 * resolves each onto a *role* variable rather than onto its own hue. That is
 * not an accident to be corrected: when those call sites were written there was
 * no hue vocabulary, so `accent="cyan"` could only have meant "the primary
 * accent, which happens to be cyan". Repointing them at `palette.cyan` would
 * change what they render.
 *
 * It matters because the names are already lying on the light level. `palette`
 * exists now, and on `sketch`:
 *
 *   accent="cyan"    renders #1450d7   palette.cyan   is #006675
 *   accent="yellow"  renders #006b2e   palette.yellow is #705a00
 *   accent="pink"    renders #bd0010   palette.pink   is #b4006c
 *
 * So a component asking for cyan gets blue, one asking for yellow gets green,
 * and one asking for pink gets red. Migrating to the role name makes the code
 * say what it does; migrating to the hue token would make it render something
 * else. Both are defensible and only one is a refactor.
