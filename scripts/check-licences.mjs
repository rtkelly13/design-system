/**
 * Does every shipped package still carry the licence it carried last time?
 *
 * `check:deps` asks whether a dependency is *justified* — every entry in
 * `package.json` has a `kind` and a `why`. It does not ask what any of them is
 * licensed under, and nothing else did either.
 *
 * That mattered the moment `@base-ui/react` arrived: nine packages entered the
 * shipped scope in one commit. #105 resolved them by hand and found them all
 * MIT, which is the right answer and the wrong mechanism — the next bump that
 * changes one is silent, and a licence change in a transitive dependency is
 * exactly the kind of thing nobody is watching for.
 *
 * ## Default-deny, by construction
 *
 * The baseline lists every shipped package and the licence it had when it was
 * recorded. A package that is not in the baseline fails, whatever its licence
 * says — so a new dependency cannot arrive unrecorded, which is the failure mode
 * rather than any particular licence being wrong.
 *
 * ## Scope is the shipped set, not the repo
 *
 * `--prod` only: `dependencies` and what they pull in. A devDependency is not
 * redistributed, and the rule that matters is depend-versus-vendor — see
 * `docs/reference-material.md`, which covers the other half, the artwork that is
 * deliberately kept out of the tree.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-licences.mjs            verify
 *   node scripts/check-licences.mjs --list     print the table
 *   node scripts/check-licences.mjs --update   rewrite the baseline
