/**
 * Do the repository's own rules still hold?
 *
 * Every other gate in this repo audits the design system. This one audits the
 * gates, because the rules that govern them are written in prose and prose does
 * not fail CI. Three of them had quietly stopped being true:
 *
 *   - **Rule 14 (pinned action SHAs) was violated at 24 of 25 sites.** A `MUST`
 *     in `AGENTS.md` since the day it was written, honoured in exactly one
 *     workflow. Nothing in the repo had ever looked.
 *   - **The gate roster drifted in three places at once.** `docs/ci.md`'s table
 *     omitted `check:tokens`, `ansi:check` and `check:api`; `docs/workflow.md`
 *     rule 6 — the list introduced with "all of these run on every PR" — omitted
 *     four of thirteen. `#144` had just corrected the same class of error one
 *     layer down, in a figure rather than a list.
 *   - **`rule N` citations pointed at the wrong rules.** Nine sites cite
 *     "AGENTS.md rule 9" meaning the timeout ceiling. Rule 9 of `AGENTS.md` was
 *     *Publishing*; the ceiling was rule 9 of `docs/workflow.md`. The two lists
 *     had diverged to eleven rules and nine, and every citation silently
 *     re-pointed as they did.
 *
 * `check:docs` gates the figures in prose against the source. This is the same
 * question asked of the rules: a rule that names a gate, a number or another
 * rule is an assertion about the repository, and this is where it is checked.
 *
 * ## What this does not do
 *
 * It checks that a rule's *references* resolve — that the action is pinned, the
 * gate is wired, the script exists, the cited rule number is the rule the other
 * file numbers the same way. It cannot check that a rule's prose still describes
 * what the workflow does; that needs the sentence understood rather than
 * matched. So `--list` prints what is covered, and the boundary is inspectable
 * rather than assumed — the same contract `check:docs` keeps.
 *
 * Every exemption below carries a reason and is itself checked: an entry that
 * stops being needed is reported, so these cannot become a place to silence the
 * gate.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-governance.mjs           fail if a rule no longer holds
 *   node scripts/check-governance.mjs --list    show every site that was checked
