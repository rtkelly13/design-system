/**
 * Does every component meet the contract?
 *
 * There was no stated contract for what a component in this package *is*, and
 * the result was measurable: **1 of 43 forwards a ref**, 29 compose classes with
 * `recipe()`, 18 spread unrecognised props. None of those is a bug in any one
 * component. Together they are why a consumer can render this package and cannot
 * compose with it.
 *
 * Clause 1 is the one that blocks work rather than merely being untidy. Base UI
 * composition is built on refs — `render` and `useRender` merge props **and a
 * ref** onto the element you supply — so `<Tooltip.Trigger render={<Button />} />`
 * cannot work until `Button` forwards one. #162 through #166 all wait on it.
 *
 * ## A ratchet, per clause
 *
 * Every budget is the count on the day this landed, and CI fails only if one
 * rises. Per clause rather than one total, so an improvement to `recipe` cannot
 * pay for a regression in `ref`.
 *
 * PR #58 is why this is not an assertion: it landed a rule set together with the
 * fixes it demanded, failed its own job, and never merged.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * - **`data-slot`.** Whether a component has parts worth targeting is a
 *   judgement — a single-element component's root already is the part, and
 *   adding a slot there is ceremony. `docs/styling.md` states the rule; #187
 *   applied it to the twelve components that needed it.
 * - **`id` on the control, not the wrapper.** Real, and cost a debugging session
 *   in #159, but not decidable by reading source. It is in the styling docs.
 *
 * A gate that claims more than it checks is worse than none.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-component-contract.mjs           verify
 *   node scripts/check-component-contract.mjs --list    print the census
