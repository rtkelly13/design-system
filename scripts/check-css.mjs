/**
 * Enforce that styling lives in TSX, not in CSS.
 *
 * The rule: a CSS file may declare custom properties and may style things that
 * have no element in a component to hang a `className` on. Everything else —
 * anything selected by a class this repo authors — belongs on the element, as
 * Tailwind utilities.
 *
 * This is checkable because "does the selector name a class we wrote" is a
 * syntactic question. Three categories are exempt, and each is exempt for a
 * reason rather than by convenience:
 *
 *   1. Custom-property declarations (`--x: …`) anywhere. Variables are the
 *      sanctioned CSS payload — `theme.css` is nothing but these.
 *   2. Selectors made only of element names, `:root`, `html`, `body`, `*` and
 *      pseudo-classes. There is no JSX element for the document, and bare tags
 *      arriving from a consumer's own markup cannot be given a className by us.
 *   3. Class names emitted by third-party tooling (remark/rehype plugins,
 *      Storybook), listed in THIRD_PARTY. We never render those elements, so
 *      there is no TSX to move the styling into.
 *
 * A ratchet: BUDGET is the count today and CI fails if it rises. Lower a line
 * as a file is migrated; delete it at zero.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-css.mjs           fail if any file exceeds budget
 *   node scripts/check-css.mjs --list    show the offending selectors
