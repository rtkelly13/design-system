/**
 * The published type surface, against a committed baseline.
 *
 * This package's whole value proposition is that consumers build against it, so
 * the change that costs them most is a breaking type change — a prop becoming
 * required, an exported name disappearing, a union losing a member. Nothing here
 * could see one. `pnpm typecheck` proves the *source* is internally consistent,
 * which it stays right up to the moment you delete an export; the visual suite
 * is three layers away; and `knip` answers a different question entirely.
 *
 * So this is deliberately the dumbest thing that works: diff the generated
 * `dist/index.d.ts` against `api/index.d.ts` in the repo. No `api-extractor`,
 * no second toolchain to keep aligned with `tsup`. What it gives up is the
 * ability to say *why* a change is breaking; what it gives is that no change
 * reaches a consumer without a human having read it in a PR diff.
 *
 * ## Comments are stripped, and that is the interesting decision
 *
 * The doc comments in this package are long and are edited often, and they are
 * documentation rather than API — a reworded paragraph is not a change a
 * consumer can observe through the type system. Baselining the file verbatim
 * would move it on nearly every PR, and a gate that always fails is a gate
 * everybody learns to update without reading. Stripping comments means the
 * baseline moves only when the shape moves, which is what makes each diff worth
 * reading.
 *
 * The cost is honest and worth stating: a doc comment that lies is invisible
 * here. That is a review problem, not a gate problem.
 *
 * ## Reading a failure
 *
 * The output is a unified-style diff of the normalised surface. If the change is
 * intended, `pnpm api:update` rewrites the baseline and the diff becomes part of
 * the PR — which is the point. If it is not, something in `src/` changed the
 * public contract by accident, and the diff names it.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-api.mjs            fail if the surface moved
 *   node scripts/check-api.mjs --update   accept the current surface
